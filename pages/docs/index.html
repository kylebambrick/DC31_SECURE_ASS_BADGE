    <h1>DC31 SECURE A.S.S. BADGE</h1>
    <p>The SECURE AUTONOMOUS SURVEILLANCE SWARM BADGE invading DEF CON 31. Read the same thing at <a href="https://secureassbadge.github.io">secureassbadge.github.io</a> or <a href="http://192.168.4.1/readme">/readme</a>.</p>
  </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <div id="secure">
    <h1>SECURE</h1>
    <p>All SWARM R.F. include the SECURE A.S.S. SYSTEM v31. To access the interface directly, connect to the SECURE A.S.S. CONSOLE SYSTEM accessible via the WIFI AP. The A.P.'s name is the SECURE A.S.S. R.F. ID (e.g., CIA-069, ASS-666, GOD-420). To prevent any potential authn/z issues, the A.P. does not require a password. (You can't break through a door that isn't there!) Once connected to the A.P., to access the 1337 webapp v3.0 interwebs, visit <a href="http://192.168.4.1/">http://192.168.4.1/</a>. Internet otherwise does not work.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>We added X secure tests for security SWAGGER testing 1337 h@x_r purple team threat model for sr princple staff engineering directors. (It's not that hard - that's what she said). Submit flags at REDACTED. More flags equals more SWAGGER. Please start by verifying the SECURE A.S.S. PROTOCOL's operating band frequency number (int, no mhz) at REDCATED to begin. Note that Flags do not have spaces. Capitalization matters. When in doubt use the capitalization as seen and remove the whitespaces.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>Also, check the readme in the REDACTED. Note that any UART interaction is horribly broken, do not access it (9600 baud rate). It's not worth your time.</p>
  </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <div id="autonomous">
    <h1>AUTONOMOUS</h1>
    <p>To change SURVEILLANCE MODE ROUTINES:</p>
    <ol><ol>
      <li>Slide the mode switch to the AUTONOMOUS position to activate AUTONOMOUS MODE</li>
      <li>Press the A button to change SURVEILLANCE MODE</li>
      <li>Press B to change the SURVEILLANCE MODE ROUTINE</li>
    </ol></ol>&nbsp;
    <p>Note that while not in AUTONOMOUS MODE (i.e., SWARM MODE), you cannot change SURVEILLANCE MODE ROUTINES via manual input or the SECURE A.S.S. CONSOLE web interface.</p>
  </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <div id="surveillance">
    <h1>SURVEILLANCE</h1>
    <p>The SECURE A.S.S. SYSTEM v31 includes REDACTED SURVEILLANCE ROUTINES over TBD SURVEILLANCE MODES controlling the REDACTED SURVEILLANCE E.Y.E. Indicators. Guess GOD-420's favorite.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>The 5 Talking A.S.S. H.O.L.E. mouth indicators say horrible things via light. See the appendix for the color code to swear word translation.</p>
  </div>&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <div id="swarm">
    <h1>SWARM</h1>
    <p>To activate SWARM MODE, slide the mode switch to the SWARM position. In the SWARM MODE, all nearby SWARM R.F.'s will synchronize SURVEILLANCE ROUTINES to the SWARM R.F.'s with the swaggeriest SWAGGER.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>SWARM communications occur via the SUPERSECURE_v31 A.S.S. PROTOCOL over REDACTED using REDACTED. It's so secure and well made you shouldn't even try to hack it. (I totally didn't shit code this last night while drunk). Given the SWARM plans to invade a conference with little R.F. activity, we gu@ran73e* the maximum range of REDACTED and fully functional communication. If weird stuff starts happening, try turning it on and off again, pressing buttons randomly, or crying into your beer.</p>
    &nbsp;
